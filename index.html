                <p class="regular-text">Every event becomes a "flag" to discover. Join them and collect playful digital artifacts, building your personal collection of neighborhood memories.</p>
                <p class="gradient-text">We've created an "impressionist city" that captures how our surroundings feel, not just how they look.<br>Explore this spatial world with friends, sharing meaningful moments instead of scrolling endless feeds.<br>Carry a bag for treasures you find, bring them home to your digital house, and curate your own collection.<br>This is about strengthening our connections and making sure our special moments become part of something lasting.<br>Come explore. Your first flag awaits.<br>Warmly,</p>
